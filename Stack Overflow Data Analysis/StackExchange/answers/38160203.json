Why would you reference AspNet Identity from Xamarin? Those are two completely different layers.</p>\n\n<p>Your server Web API has to expose REST methods to handle authentication/authorization and other stuff so a client can consume them (web client, mobile client, desktop client, whatever). </p>\n\n<p>Xamarin should consume those remote methods with a <a href=\"https://github.com/paulcbetts/refit\" rel=\"nofollow\">REST client</a>, in the same fashion a javascript client would. </p>\n\n<p>I understand from your question that you want to reuse business objects / models in your xamarin project just because they are written in C#. But if those objects have dependencies on asp.net identity, you can\u00b4t.\nIn that case you should <a href=\"http://automapper.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">map</a> your business objects (BO) to data transfer objects (DTO) that web API will use to communicate with clients.\nDTO\u00b4s are completely agnostic from any data access layer and should be simple <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/250001/poco-definition\">POCO</a>\u00b4s. They are meant to be serialized/deserialized to/from json/xml.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, you don\u00b4t want to serialize user models \"as is\" through a web api because that implies sending sensitive data over the internet like user hashed passwords, etc. Your DTO\u00b4s should just have the fields needed in your client, and the mapping will do the rest.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1467547259, "answer_id": 38160203, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 1850606, "reputation": 1901, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 86, "display_name": "xleon", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1850606/xleon", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b9371d959d3460b285f7f5f679a45c73?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1467547259, "question_id": 38158616}
