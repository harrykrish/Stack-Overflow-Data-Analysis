{"title": "How can I use reflection with Java 9 on the Java internals?", "tags": ["reflection", "classloader", "java-9"], "creation_date": 1466588717, "score": 3, "body": "<p>Accessing module-internal classes can not be done from code. This is on purpose. But there is a workaround from the command line - a non-standardized option on <code>java</code> that does what you want:</p>\n\n<pre><code>--add-exports &lt;module&gt;/&lt;package&gt;=&lt;target-module&gt;(,&lt;target-module&gt;)*\n                  updates &lt;module&gt; to export &lt;package&gt; to &lt;target-module&gt;,\n                  regardless of module declaration.\n                  &lt;target-module&gt; can be ALL-UNNAMED to export to all\n                  unnamed modules.\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Note</h3>\n\n<p>Java 9 is a moving target and the exact syntax has been changed a couple of times - as was this answer. This means (a) some of the comments below may seem outdated and (b) the flag might not work exactly like that. Please leave a comment and it will get fixed.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477734912, "answer_id": 37964312, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 2525313, "reputation": 2318, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 86, "display_name": "Nicolai Parlog", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/2525313/nicolai-parlog", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13eee0ac5d38daea3d6ca6aa6efea5b3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1477734912, "question_id": 37961954}
