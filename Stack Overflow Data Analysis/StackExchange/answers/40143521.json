Details <a href=\"https://docs.arangodb.com/3.0/Manual/Administration/Arangoimp.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. You can simply Arangodump your Arango 2.8 files, uninstall ArangoDB 2.8, install 3.0, and import them into Arango 3.0. I don't have any experience running two versions simultaneously, but unless they are containerized I would not recommend trying, as both versions, when locally installed, use files in a directory with the same name (<code>/usr/share/arangodb</code>).</p>\n", "tags": ["arangodb"], "creation_date": 1476922629, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1476922629, "answer_id": 40143521, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 5552014, "reputation": 166, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 53, "display_name": "Nate Gardner", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5552014/nate-gardner", "profile_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--_ZWSqH8tU0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABoI/AIL-0NU4Bg0/photo.jpg?sz=128"}, "title": "Can I have ArangoDB 2.8 and ArangoDB 3 on the same server?", "question_id": 40131195}
