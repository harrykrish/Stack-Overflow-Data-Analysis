{"body": "<p>Probably not the best solution, but this is what I did to solve the problem:</p>\n\n<p>I changed to the second option of the url, so when a user selects an option in the combobox, it is sent to a URL like: myshop.myshopify.com/collections/my-collection?filter_by=my-filter </p>\n\n<p>In product-grid-item.liquid, I'm getting the metafield value of the product and displaying it as a class, and hide all the products as default. In the collection.liquid I read with javascript the value of the parameter (filter_by) and remove the \"hide\" class of the products with the value of the filter_by as class, so it gets displayed. </p>\n\n<p>I feel that it is not very clean, but it is working as expected. Problems with this solution:\n * Not displaying all the products and then filtering them\n * I need to display all the products to avoid pagination, which could be a big problem if I have a lot of products. </p>\n\n<p>If anyone could post a better solution, welcome!. </p>\n", "tags": ["shopify", "liquid", "liquid-layout"], "creation_date": 1477674827, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477674827, "answer_id": 40310068, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 3801876, "reputation": 11, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "vramiguez", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3801876/vramiguez", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5e81f2b5948ba258a802e4df3f4b431?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "title": "Shopify: Filtering collections by custom filter", "question_id": 40273021}
