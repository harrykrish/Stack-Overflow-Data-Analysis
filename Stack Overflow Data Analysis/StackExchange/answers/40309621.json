{"body": "<p>I somehow sensed that I am not using the right version of </p>\n\n<p><strong>EF tools for Visual Studio 2013</strong></p>\n\n<p>with corresponding version of <strong>MYSQL server installation</strong> and <strong>mysqlconnector for .net</strong>. So i downloaded and compared several versions of EF tools, MYSQL installer and MYSQL(Nuget package) for entity framework and finally found the right combination as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Entity Framework 6.1.3 tools for Visual Studio 2013</li>\n<li>MYSQL-installer-community-5.6.32.0.msi (you can find archived mysql<br>\nversion in google)</li>\n<li>MYSQL(Nuget package) for entity framework like in the screen shot below:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aPJ43.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aPJ43.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>As it worked for me , i think mysql.data dll version and mysqlconnector for net that comes with MYSQL installer should match , i have them highlighted here in picture:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3rdTX.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3rdTX.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>After the proper installation ,i finally got EDMX diagram loaded fully and correctly upon creating one.</p>\n\n<p>P.S: after every un-installation of MYSQL server version that did not work for me, I used the useful tool (Advanced_Uninstaller11.exe) to clean all left out registry entries and here is the download link for the tool \n<a href=\"http://www.advanceduninstaller.com/MySQL-for-Visual-Studio-1_1_3-6356838ad4797617b2a4c62e5a36c89c-application.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">enter link description here</a></p>\n\n<p>I Hope that I have explained it clearly of the problem and its resolution. I could not make any of the above points or scenario clear, hope you would comment on it and i would try to explain more and better. </p>\n\n<p>And Thank you @ErikEJ for your continued support on the problem.</p>\n", "tags": ["mysql", "asp.net-mvc", "entity-framework"], "creation_date": 1477673174, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477673174, "answer_id": 40309621, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 970999, "reputation": 21, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "NepdeBrio", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/970999/nepdebrio", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/693c6abd66076146287c497ccb10fb0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Cannot create .edmx for MySql Database with mysql.data.entity.EF6 in Visual Studio", "question_id": 40202467}
