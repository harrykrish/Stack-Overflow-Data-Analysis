{"title": "WP CLI Shell not working on Windows", "tags": ["windows", "wordpress", "command-line-interface"], "creation_date": 1477557482, "score": 0, "body": "<p>You seem to be mixing the instructions for installing WP-CLI via Composer with the instructions for installing manually. You need to stick with one or the other. I remember following the manual installation instructions and everything went fine. Follow just those instructions. Forget about Composer for now.</p>\n\n<p><code>wget</code> is a Unix program and does not work on Windows without specifically installing it. Don't use it for this installation.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like either <code>WP-CLI</code> or <code>PHP</code> is missing from your global path. Follow the instructions at <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/faq.installation.php#faq.installation.addtopath\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://php.net/manual/en/faq.installation.php#faq.installation.addtopath</a> to ensure PHP is executable globally. Specifically the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Go to Control Panel and open the System icon (Start \u2192 Control Panel)</p>\n  \n  <p>Go to the Advanced tab</p>\n  \n  <p>Click on the 'Environment Variables' button</p>\n  \n  <p>Look into the 'System Variables' pane</p>\n  \n  <p>Find the Path entry (you may need to scroll to find it)</p>\n  \n  <p>Double click on the Path entry</p>\n  \n  <p>Enter your PHP directory at the end, including ';' before (e.g.\n  ;C:\\php)</p>\n  \n  <p>Press OK</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Do the same for the path to the <code>WP-CLI</code> executable. Result should look somewhat like my own PATH below.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mNK2x.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mNK2x.png\" alt=\"windows path\"></a></p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477559009, "answer_id": 40279925, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 3003045, "reputation": 1670, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 100, "display_name": "James Jones", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3003045/james-jones", "profile_image": "https://graph.facebook.com/100001148539277/picture?type=large"}, "last_edit_date": 1477559009, "question_id": 40279141}
