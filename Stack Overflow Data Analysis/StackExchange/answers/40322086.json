{"body": "<p>This bug is already reported (<a href=\"http://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/17406\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/17406</a>)</p>\n\n<p>After reading the description, I came to know that if I create wxPopupWindow/wxPopupTransientWindow into modal wxDialog constructor, then wxDialog is added as it's parent. So do not create wxPopupWIndow in modal wxDialog constructor.</p>\n\n<p>I found 2 ways to deal with issue:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Do not create in wxDialog constructor. Create wxPopupWindow when you need it (i.e. on mouse hover, button click etc.)</p></li>\n<li><p>If want to create one time in constructor and use it later many time, use <strong>CallAfter</strong> to create it. CallAfter will schedule <strong>wxPopupWindow</strong> creation for next round after constructor call finishes.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I know this is not a good fix, but this is what I found as immediate solution.</p>\n", "tags": ["wxwidgets"], "creation_date": 1477764594, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477764594, "answer_id": 40322086, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 3659387, "reputation": 331, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 4, "display_name": "Anil8753", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3659387/anil8753", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/swdXW.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "Popup wxPopupTransientWindow with wxDialog as parent on Mac", "question_id": 40282116}
