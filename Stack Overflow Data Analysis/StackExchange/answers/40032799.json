{"body": "<p>It looks like this is a view lifecycle issue. <code>viewDidLoad</code> on the child controller is getting called before <code>prepareForSegue</code> is called or at least before it is completed on the parent. Looking around I see conflicting info on whether this is supposed to happen and I don't typically use storyboards so I'm not positive myself. In any case, an easy fix in your case is just to move your image setting code out of <code>viewDidLoad</code> and into <code>viewWillAppear</code>. The URL should definitely be set by that point and your optional will be unwrapped successfully.</p>\n", "tags": ["ios", "swift", "uitableview", "segue", "swift3"], "creation_date": 1476402529, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1476402529, "answer_id": 40032799, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 484304, "reputation": 17819, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 67, "display_name": "Dima", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/484304/dima", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/866fd50b077d3d8bf4ce63ec68bc1dae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Error in Swift 3 update - Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an optional value", "question_id": 40032633}
