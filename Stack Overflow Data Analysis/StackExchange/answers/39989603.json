{"title": "stm32l0: Failed to execute MI command. Error erasing flash with vFlashErase packet", "tags": ["eclipse", "stm32"], "creation_date": 1476239582, "score": 0, "body": "<p>This is an OpenOCD issue, not a problem with your code. I got this issue when the debugger command file was referring to a \"stlink-v2-1\" but what I actually have is an \"stlink-v2\". I'm using the STM32F0 Discovery board.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the Nucleo board has the \"stlink-v2-1\" so you might have the opposite problem as me. Check to make sure that the setting under \"Run menu > Debug Configurations > Debugger > OpenOCD setup\" is set to the correct debugger. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7dVVT.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7dVVT.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>If a debug configuration file is being used (the \"use default script\" or \"use local script\" option is selected) open that file and look for a line like: </p>\n\n<pre><code>source [find interface/stlink-v2.cfg]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my case the project wizard had created a template that was referencing stlink-v2-1. Changing it to the above fixed the problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I also got this problem when Eclipse crashed and left OpenOCD running in the background. Run</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ ps aux | grep openocd\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And if you see an instance of OpenOCD running when the debugger is not, kill it. </p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1476240550, "answer_id": 39989603, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 1161906, "reputation": 3201, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 71, "display_name": "bcattle", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1161906/bcattle", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b277799216786bcf68c9713ce31c39da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1476240550, "question_id": 38914955}
