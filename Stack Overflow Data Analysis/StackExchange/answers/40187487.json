Toggle the flag to cover all values in range [0-(2^n-1)], and produce the string corresponding to those bit pattern.</p>\n\n<p>Good question to learn bitwise shift operation and bit-pattern/masking. So try coding yourself.</p>\n", "tags": ["java"], "creation_date": 1477100259, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477100259, "answer_id": 40187487, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 1465553, "reputation": 1444, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 75, "display_name": "Saurav Sahu", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1465553/saurav-sahu", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b559f395549789c041652429444dc0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "use for loop to reorder string&#39;s characters in a pattern", "question_id": 40187413}
