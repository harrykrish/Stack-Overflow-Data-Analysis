You need to make sure, that you've installed it in the environment that is used by your django.</p>\n\n<p>Try typing <code>pip list</code> in the shell you usually use to kick your django with <code>python manage.py runserver</code> to figure out what is installed there.</p>\n\n<p>If your django lives inside of a IDE like PyCharm - you need to check the project settings there for the environment used to launch django.</p>\n\n<p>As you don't use virtualenv (which is highly recommended) you install your modules system wide. If you are on linux there might be python3 and python (which is python 2). If your pip belongs to python2 and you have installed django in python3 or vice versa this might be the issue.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1475252584, "answer_id": 39793497, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 5992118, "reputation": 839, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "dahrens", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5992118/dahrens", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08ae2e7ce567cbfb93d480892bd10fa0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1475252584, "question_id": 39793464}
