(For more info, see MDN on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy\" rel=\"nofollow\">same-origin policy</a>.) Chrome is <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=512542\" rel=\"nofollow\">very strict</a> with file URLs' security origins in particular, but I've found that unknowingly breaking the same origin policy can happen for other reasons too (such as developing in webpack-dev-server with Chrome Dev Tools open) this can happen surprisingly easily.  See <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=655694\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Chrome issue</a> for discussion.</p>\n\n<p>A workaround is to test in a simpler, closer-to-production environment: running over a plain HTTP server (<a href=\"http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-really-simple-http-server-python\" rel=\"nofollow\">SimpleHTTPServer</a> works well), with Dev Tools closed if necessary.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477685486, "answer_id": 40027552, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 25507, "reputation": 34454, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 81, "display_name": "Josh Kelley", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/25507/josh-kelley", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/DqZPI.png?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1477685486, "question_id": 40026381}
