This is just how NuGet works. When Xamarin.Forms\n  updates these packages will auto update.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Forms gets 'linked' to a specific version of the Android libraries so it can be guaranteed that it will work together as it should. At this point, Xamarin.Forms (stable) isn't updated yet to use the latest Android Support packages. So you probably want to go with a somewhat older version of Forms, or check if there is a Forms pre-release which already has a reference to the newer Android Support libraries. </p>\n\n<p>Of course; using these is not recommended in a production environment.</p>\n\n<p>They added it in the official <a href=\"https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/troubleshooting/#What_causes_this_error\" rel=\"nofollow\">FAQ</a></p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477393454, "answer_id": 38398301, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 1506387, "reputation": 5336, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "Gerald Versluis", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1506387/gerald-versluis", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f9d4d4211d7956ce3e07e83df0889731?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1477393454, "question_id": 38398111}
