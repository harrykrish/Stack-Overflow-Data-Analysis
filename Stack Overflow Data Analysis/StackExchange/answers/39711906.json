{"title": "Encryption and decryption with ASCII in C++", "tags": ["c++", "ascii"], "creation_date": 1474922062, "score": 0, "body": "<p>I did something similar to this in my level one programming class last year. We created a Vigenere Cipher that is based off of the architecture of the Cesar cipher.\nSomething that is useful is to first create a 0 base, i.e. if you are working with values a through b, subtract a from each of the characters that you are encoding first, do the math, double check that the value falls within the range of values (32 through 126 == 0 through 94) and then return the char + a. This would mean rewriting your logic and function to take a char instead of the entire string at once.\nAs for why you are getting '^' as your only output, the ACSII code for '^' is 94 and your code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for ( int i = 0; i &lt; decryption.length(); i ++)\n    {\n        decryption[i]--;\n        if (i &gt; 126){\n            decrypt  = i + 94;\n        }\n        else if (i &lt; 32){\n            decrypt = i - 94;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is setting the entire string to char 94. You set i = 0 then say that if i is less than 32 then the string decrypt is equal to the char 0 + 94 which is equal to 94 which is equal to '^' </p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1474922449, "answer_id": 39711906, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 6883459, "reputation": 21, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "DRoc101", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/6883459/droc101", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/jEZWo.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1474922449, "question_id": 39711430}
