{"body": "<p>The size that an image take in memory is not 1MB, The actual size that an image take in memory can be counted as:</p>\n\n<p>Lets assume you have a image <code>2000x1250</code>. It needs <code>4x2000x1250</code> bytes of memory. \nEach pixel has a part of red, green, blue and alpha channel information.</p>\n\n<p>So the actual size that would take in memory would be something like <code>4x2000x1250=10000000 Byte -&gt; 9.5MB</code></p>\n\n<p>The best way to load the images is using a library, Libraries takes good care of recycling the bitmaps and loading the images, caching them etc.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the collecting of my favorite ones, you can try and use whichever suits your needs. I always prefer the first one.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bumptech/glide\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glide</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/square/picasso\" rel=\"nofollow\">Picasso</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/fresco\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fresco</a></p>\n", "tags": ["java", "c#", "android", "memory", "xamarin.android"], "creation_date": 1476681325, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1476681325, "answer_id": 40078913, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 5699956, "reputation": 1959, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 79, "display_name": "Max Rockwood", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5699956/max-rockwood", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f8a27337886706b303e88cf00edb24e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Android memory limit test issue?", "question_id": 39950377}
