{"body": "<p>You have the Ellipsis center of (a, b) and an arbitrary point of P(Px, Py). The equation of the line defined by these two points looks like this:</p>\n\n<p>(Y - Py) / (b - Py) = (X - Px) / (a - Px)</p>\n\n<p>The other form you have is an ellipse. You need to find out which are the (X, Y) points which are both on the ellipse and on the line between the center and the point. There will be two such points and you need to calculate both their distance from P and choose the smaller distance.</p>\n", "tags": ["swift", "math", "swift3", "distance", "ellipse"], "creation_date": 1477150945, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477150945, "answer_id": 40193974, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 436560, "reputation": 16633, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 86, "display_name": "Lajos Arpad", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/436560/lajos-arpad", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GESV.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "Distance from point to ellipse", "question_id": 40193867}
