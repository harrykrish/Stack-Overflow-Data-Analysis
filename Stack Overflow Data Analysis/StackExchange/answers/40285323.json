{"body": "<p>You're having a problem because your csv files have a blank column at the end... which makes your data end in a comma:</p>\n\n<p><code>04/09/14 00:01:00,04/09/14 00:01:00,2.221220E-003,5.797364E-004,0.000000E+000,1.641484E-003,</code></p>\n\n<p>This leads R to think your data consists of 7 columns rather than 6. The correct solution is to resave all your csv files correctly. Otherwise, R will see 7 columns but only 6 columnnames, and will logically think that the first column is rownames. Here you can apply the patch we came up with @konradrudolph: </p>\n\n<p><code>library(tibble)\ndf %&gt;% rownames_to_column() %&gt;% setNames(c(colnames(.)[-1], 'DROP')) %&gt;% select(-DROP)</code></p>\n\n<p>where <code>df</code> is the data from the csv. But patches like this can lead to unexpected results... better save the csv files correctly.</p>\n", "tags": ["r", "csv"], "creation_date": 1477573418, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477573418, "answer_id": 40285323, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 2883603, "reputation": 713, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 68, "display_name": "Amit Kohli", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/2883603/amit-kohli", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdFWO.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "How to read and name different CSV files in R", "question_id": 40284146}
