{"body": "<p>Finally resolved the issue. The problem was in the following, I had another <code>ShopRepository</code> in different application module, which was not annotated with <code>@RepositoryRestResource</code> and it was the one which was used when accessing it using REST.</p>\n\n<p>The following line of configuration in custom <code>RepositoryRestConfigurerAdapter</code> fixed the exploration of repositories which need to be exposed, so only annotated ones are exposed now:</p>\n\n<pre><code>config.setRepositoryDetectionStrategy(RepositoryDetectionStrategy.RepositoryDetectionStrategies.ANNOTATED);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After that I could not access the resource at all using REST, so I've figured out that it is not visible to <code>Spring</code>. I just had to enable Mongo repositories on API level with annotation <code>@EnableMongoRepositories</code>.</p>\n", "tags": ["java", "spring", "spring-mvc", "spring-security", "spring-data-rest"], "creation_date": 1476975683, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1476975683, "answer_id": 40158046, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 1889928, "reputation": 1956, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 90, "display_name": "Yuriy Yunikov", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1889928/yuriy-yunikov", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c6b04157e65ab1a1e0e61d220d06341d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Spring Data Rest + Spring Security: @Secured not working", "question_id": 40130169}
