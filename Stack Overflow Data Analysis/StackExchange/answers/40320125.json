{"body": "<p>There's nothing about taking a <code>float</code> from the keyboard that makes it inherently less precise than any other <code>float</code>. Having said that, in taking a <code>float</code> from the keyboard, you run the risk of two numbers that are different being stored as the same value as the difference between the two numbers is less than the epsilon for single precision floats. However, this is no different from any other usage of floats. In summary, a <code>float</code> acquired from <code>scanf</code> is no different than any other <code>float</code>, and any safety measures you would or wouldn't normally use should be used with these floats as well.</p>\n", "tags": ["c", "floating-point", "precision", "floating-accuracy"], "creation_date": 1477751486, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477751486, "answer_id": 40320125, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 5021321, "reputation": 2041, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 75, "display_name": "Eli Sadoff", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5021321/eli-sadoff", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29f10a1b457e63d44e3a221e89e32c17?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Comparing floats in C", "question_id": 40320076}
