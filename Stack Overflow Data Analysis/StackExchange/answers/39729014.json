{"title": "How to re-render django template code on AJAX call", "tags": ["jquery", "ajax", "django", "django-pagination"], "creation_date": 1474991145, "score": 0, "body": "<p>If you want to rely on django templates you should reload the page and send over the pagination information in the requests. This is what is usually done (e.g. in django-admin). It requires reloading the page, but this is what django templates are made for.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise i would delegate the whole rendering over to the client and provide only a JSON view inside of django. This way django will provide a template that includes some markup together with your favorite js library, that takes care of making the AJAX calls and renders the data directly on it's own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you really need to do this, the approach you mentioned is possible. Nothing stops you from rendering a part of your template, outsourced in separate file and send the already rendered HTML over to your client.</p>\n\n<p>Therefor you can utilize the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/es/1.10/ref/templates/builtins/#include\" rel=\"nofollow\">include template tag</a> to move the table template into a separate file.\nFor the AJAX calls you should use a second view, that just renders the table part of your template.</p>\n\n<p>All this feels a hacky to me, but it should work.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1474992487, "answer_id": 39729014, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 5992118, "reputation": 839, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "dahrens", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5992118/dahrens", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08ae2e7ce567cbfb93d480892bd10fa0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1474992487, "question_id": 39727698}
