{"title": "How to get index of an array with MouseListener?", "tags": ["java", "arrays", "mouselistener"], "creation_date": 1476749772, "score": 0, "body": "<p>Your question is (I think) how can I retrieve the cell number for the component that has been clicked on? If so, the simplest solution is to have a mouse listener that is specific to each text area. </p>\n\n<p>For example, you could have the following method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private JTextArea makeCell(final int id) {\n    JTextArea cell = new JTextArea(DIM_OF_CELLS, DIM_OF_CELLS));\n    cell.setBorder(...);\n    cell.setEditable(false);\n    cell.addMouseListener(new MouseAdaptor() {\n        public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent ev) {\n            String text = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(\"Set text for date: \");\n            allCells[id].get.setText(text);      \n        }\n    });\n    return cell;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However I think you're underlying problem is that you have only half encapsulated the <code>CellBox</code> class. Rather than having a <code>getCell</code> method to give access to the <code>JTextArea</code> you would be better off creating the component inside that class as well as providing the mouse listener. Then you wouldn't need to access the cell with the index at all. In fact I doubt you'd need to store the index at all.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class CellBox {\n    private final JTextArea cell;\n\n    public CellBox() {\n        cell = new JTextArea(DIM_OF_CELLS, DIM_OF_CELLS));\n        cell.setBorder(...);\n        cell.setEditable(false);\n        cell.addMouseListener(new MouseAdaptor() {\n            public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent ev) {\n                String text = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(\"Set text for date: \");\n                cell.setText(text);      \n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "last_activity_date": 1476750259, "answer_id": 40097592, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 3705127, "reputation": 10046, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 53, "display_name": "sprinter", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3705127/sprinter", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b03aedaddfa4dc1c2b331f318a724ec7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1476750259, "question_id": 40097339}
