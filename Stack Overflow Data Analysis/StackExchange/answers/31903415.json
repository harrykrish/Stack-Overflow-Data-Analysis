You just want to stick with the current configuration and enjoy what it gives to you. Spring and other frameworks are absolutely different in concepts and features, so you have a lot of time working on rewriting the software to be available to use these technologies that you don't need. Struts 2 is more appropriate candidate for migration from Struts 1. </p>\n\n<p>Make sure you've read <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/20130845/573032\">Migration from Struts 1 to Struts 2</a> for steps towards this process.  </p>\n\n<p>You can find <a href=\"http://struts.apache.org/docs/comparing-struts-1-and-2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pros and Cons comparing Struts 1 and Struts 2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To add to these features I'd say that Struts 2 not only bigger but heavier  than Struts 1. Struts 2 in the default configuration intercepts and runs a lot of stuff to easy the development process, write less code, use recent technologies, but the cost for it is a complexity. You will have more time to learn framework itself to be able to modify it to suit your needs. </p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477309421, "answer_id": 31903415, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 573032, "reputation": 34515, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 91, "display_name": "Roman C", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/573032/roman-c", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bca617231294691f95f0e9f0ee623630?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1477309421, "question_id": 31902705}
