{"body": "<p>After updating the Android appcompat library version to <code>25.0.0</code> and a few trial and errors, I have figured that the appcompat library version can be updated to the latest version which is currently <code>25.0.0</code> but the <code>targetSdkVersion</code> in the <code>android/app/build.gradle</code> file for the app has to be kept at <code>22</code> because of the new permission model that has been introduced in API level 23 which is not fully integrated into <code>react-native</code> yet. You may change the <code>targetSdkVersion</code> to <code>25</code> as well but you may need to add some code to explicitly request permissions for the phone resources which were granted automatically in API level 22 and below if the permission is present in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file.</p>\n", "tags": ["react-native", "react-native-android"], "creation_date": 1477715487, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477715487, "answer_id": 40316039, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 2923135, "reputation": 392, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 90, "display_name": "Varun Gupta", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/2923135/varun-gupta", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/51fb05e46e1a530cf39fb481ea2abc3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "title": "Update android appcompat library version in react-native", "question_id": 40230948}
