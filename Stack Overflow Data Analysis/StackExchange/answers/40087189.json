So something like <code>a$column1 &lt;- gsub(\"red.+\",\"red\",a$column)</code>, and then rinse and repeat for the rest. I don't know how to match the \"other\" category... that will have to be done manually.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have proper names, <code>match</code> would work well here:</p>\n\n<p>the result you want should be obtained by using: <code>map$y[match(a$column1,map$x)]</code>. The inside part does the match, and the <code>map$y</code> part gives you the property you want.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1476711218, "answer_id": 40087189, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 2883603, "reputation": 713, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 68, "display_name": "Amit Kohli", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/2883603/amit-kohli", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdFWO.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1476711218, "question_id": 40087099}
