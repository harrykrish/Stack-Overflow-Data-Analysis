{"body": "<p>I wasn't right. I found out that it actually can be done with Redis Cluster. We have to create one master node and assign all hash slots to it. After that we have to create slave nodes and replicate the master. In this situation we will have an automatic failover and all nodes will keep the same data.</p>\n\n<p>To set a slave node. I.e. replicate a master we need to use the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>./redis-trib.rb add-node --slave --master-id {master_id} {master_ip}:{master_port} {slave_ip}:{slave_port}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or we can add a new empty master:</p>\n\n<pre><code>./redis-trib.rb add-node {any_node_ip_in_cluster}:{port} {new_node_ip}:{port}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then turn it to the slave:</p>\n\n<pre><code>redis {master_ip}:{master_port}&gt; cluster replicate {master_id}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>P.S. Redis has a requirement to have a minimum of 3 masters but it isn't a hard limit of the cluster. We still can have only one master node and it will be totally fine.</p>\n", "tags": ["caching", "redis", "replication", "key-value", "database-replication"], "creation_date": 1477497175, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477497175, "answer_id": 40266827, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 3846192, "reputation": 548, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 81, "display_name": "Alexandr", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3846192/alexandr", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/ePINS.png?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "Is it possible to let a write request pass by a slave directly to the master in Redis?", "question_id": 40249185}
