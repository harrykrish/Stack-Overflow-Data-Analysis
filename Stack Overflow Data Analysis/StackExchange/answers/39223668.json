{"body": "<p>I think I found the root of the problem. Deep in the internals of Datatables, in a function called <code>_fnBuildAjax</code>, even if you don't give anything as a <code>data</code> parameter, there are two lines that do the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var tmp = {};\n// ...if data is empty...\ndata = tmp;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This ends up passing an empty object to the jQuery ajax call further down near the bottom of the same function. Normally jQuery would take this empty object and not change the call, but since <code>processData</code> is <code>false</code>, jQuery appends it to the URL (being a GET request after all) and turns it into <code>[object%20Object]</code> even though it is <strong>an empty object</strong>. This only happens with Datatables because elsewhere in my code I am giving simply not specifying a <code>data</code> parameter for an Ajax call and jQuery is smart enough simply not to append anything to the URL, but when it sees an empty object it doesn't know what to do and appends it as is. I hope this helps future programmers debug this edge case :). Thanks again to @war10ck for his explanation.</p>\n", "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "ajax", "datatables"], "creation_date": 1472549222, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1472549222, "answer_id": 39223668, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 99971, "reputation": 2957, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 85, "display_name": "daveslab", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/99971/daveslab", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e14c474117597f3b8c7c6489a5ace397?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Setting `processData: false` in jQuery + Datatables appends unknown stuff to URL of my Ajax calls", "question_id": 39207203}
