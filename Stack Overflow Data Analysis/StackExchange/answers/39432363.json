{"body": "<p>Well this took me some serious amount of time to work through. </p>\n\n<p>The problem was as follows:</p>\n\n<p>I have a while loop </p>\n\n<pre><code>while ( $row = $stmt-&gt;fetch() ) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This means if I set $row to something other than $stmt->fetch(), the while loop will end. I knew that from the start, hence calling the second $row1. </p>\n\n<p>What I wasn't also realizing is that means if I used $stmt to perform other functions within the while loop, it to would break the while loop. </p>\n\n<p>The solution was simply to use a different variable in the time functions.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    $ttime = new DateTime($tttime);\n\n    $stmt2=$db-&gt;prepare('SELECT timezone FROM member_credits WHERE username = :user');\n    $stmt2-&gt;bindParam(':user', $username);\n    $stmt2-&gt;execute();\n    $row1 = $stmt2-&gt;fetch();\n\n    $usersTimezone = (new DateTimeZone($row1[timezone]));\n    $ttime-&gt;setTimeZone($usersTimezone);\n    $ttimee = $ttime-&gt;format('h:i, A');\n</code></pre>\n", "tags": ["php", "mysql", "loops", "timezone"], "creation_date": 1473561750, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1473561750, "answer_id": 39432363, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 597390, "reputation": 397, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 73, "display_name": "Bruce", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/597390/bruce", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/70b7c25422d6a8ce865dcf12f7d2be49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Timezone looping issues in php", "question_id": 39431361}
