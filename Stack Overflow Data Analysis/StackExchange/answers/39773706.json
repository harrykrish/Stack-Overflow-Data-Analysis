{"title": "Why are the iterators not compatible?", "tags": ["c++", "vector", "iterator"], "creation_date": 1475161080, "score": 0, "body": "<p>Your error doesn't have anything to do with strings or ints or conversions. It's because you're creating a new copy of <code>vector&lt;string&gt; word</code> every time you call <code>findString</code>, and so its returned iterator is an iterator of a different vector (it's an iterator into a copy). You have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt;::iterator findString(vector&lt;string&gt; word, string x)\n{\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then later, where the error is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt;::iterator t = findString(word, x);\n\nif (t != word.end()) //A: Error happens in this line.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And so <code>findString</code> is returning an iterator into a copy of word instead of word itself, and MS' vector implementation has an assertion failure when you try to compare it with an iterator from a different vector, because it figures you most likely made a mistake. Instead pass your vectors by reference, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt;::iterator findString(vector&lt;string&gt; &amp; word, string x)\n{\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that word is now passed by reference, and so won't be copied.</p>\n\n<p>That said, you should fix your error first as an exercise, of course, but after you've got your own code working, consider replacing <code>findString</code> with <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/find\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>std::find</code></a> (since it already exists). Also it seems you can simplify your code greatly by using a <code>map&lt;string,int&gt;</code> to maintain word counts. And a few other things.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1475161491, "answer_id": 39773706, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 616460, "reputation": 23170, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 96, "display_name": "Jason C", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/616460/jason-c", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yiloe.png?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1475161491, "question_id": 39773225}
