{"body": "<p>The problem is in your <code>sixPtdStar()</code> function. </p>\n\n<pre><code>def sixPtdStar(sz):\n   triangle(sz)\n   tess.lt(90)\n   tess.pu()\n   tess.fd(80) # here \n   tess.rt(90)\n   tess.fd(120) # and here\n   tess.pd()\n   tess.rt(180)\n   triangle(sz)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If your function takes a size as a parameter, all functions involving movement (such as <code>forward()</code> or <code>goto()</code>) need to be scaled by the size as well. The following code should work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def sixPtdStar(sz):\n   triangle(sz)\n   tess.lt(90)\n   tess.pu()\n   tess.fd((2.0/3.0)*sz) #formerly 80\n   tess.rt(90)\n   tess.fd(sz) #formerly 120\n   tess.pd()\n   tess.rt(180)\n   triangle(sz)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will ensure that all forward movements are proportional to the size of the object you create. You will need to make similar tweaks to your <code>rowOfStars()</code> function. I've also noticed that your six pointed star isn't fully symmetrical. You could resolve that by replacing  <code>tess.fd((2.0/3.0)*sz)</code> with <code>tess.fd((7.0/12.0)*sz)</code>. </p>\n", "tags": ["python", "graphics", "python-3.5", "turtle-graphics"], "creation_date": 1477269896, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477269896, "answer_id": 40209282, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 6432683, "reputation": 21, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 100, "display_name": "wptreanor", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/6432683/wptreanor", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f3822be32149f3d124b04f9e7aa3524?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "title": "Using turtle in Python to draw six-pointed stars with different side lengths", "question_id": 40209092}
