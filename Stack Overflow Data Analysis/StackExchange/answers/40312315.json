{"title": "How to use Selenium chromedriver without being forced to update?", "tags": ["node.js", "selenium", "selenium-webdriver", "selenium-chromedriver", "nwjs"], "creation_date": 1477684277, "score": 0, "body": "<p>I was able to solve my problem by using <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chromium</a>, however, I did test to make sure it would work with Chrome as well.  The problem with Chrome is that you can't easily find older releases and they can (and do) change the way you disable auto-updates with more recent versions.  There are several suggestions out there for disabling auto updates in Chrome, some are more valid than others.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to download a previous version of Chromium following the guidelines on the website (in this case it uses version 44 as an example):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Look in <a href=\"http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/search/label/Stable%20updates\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/search/label/Stable%20updates</a>\n  for the last time \"44.\" was mentioned.</li>\n  <li>Loop up that version history (\"44.0.2403.157\") in the <a href=\"https://omahaproxy.appspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Position Lookup</a></li>\n  <li>In this case it returns a base position of \"330231\". This is the commit of where the 44 release was branched, back in May 2015.*</li>\n  <li>Open the <a href=\"https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">continuous builds archive</a></li>\n  <li>Click through on your platform (Linux/Mac/Win)</li>\n  <li>Paste \"330231\" into the filter field at the top and wait for all the results to XHR in.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> that sometimes the number will not match and you have to scroll through the list to the next lowest match you see.  I had to go back several matches to find a working copy in my situation.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have a binary here is the javascript logic to use it ( More info can be found in the <a href=\"http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/chrome.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Selenium Docs</a> ):</p>\n\n<pre><code>// get the webdriver for future operations\nvar webdriver = require(\"selenium-webdriver\");\n// configure the chromedriver\nvar chrome = require(\"selenium-webdriver/chrome\");\n// here I get the path of chromedriver to avoid using path variables\nvar path = new require(\"chromedriver\").path;\nvar service = new chrome.ServiceBuilder(path).build();\n\nvar options = new chrome.Options();\n// Note: on mac you need to reach in the .app folder\noptions.setChromeBinaryPath(\"Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium\");\n\nvar driver = new chrome.Driver(options, service);\n</code></pre>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477684695, "answer_id": 40312315, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 2105636, "reputation": 2550, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 100, "display_name": "Matthew Sanders", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/2105636/matthew-sanders", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/A8kiD.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1477684695, "question_id": 40288651}
