Name your entities in singular, so you can differ from a list (\"restaurants\") and a single entity (\"restaurant\").</p>\n\n<p>To fix your problem, just add the column manually to your database or let eclipseLink handle schema- and table-creation. Just add the following property to your <code>persistence.xml</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;property name=\"eclipselink.ddl-generation\" value=\"create-or-extend-tables\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now on deploy eclipseLink will create new tables, join-tables and columns whenever there is a change in your entities. This is the very lazy and handy approach to automate your database-creation.</p>\n\n<p>Oh one sidenote: looks like you copy-pasted a lot of abstract classes from outside projects to your project (AbstractEntity, AbstractDAO), since I've seen that code many times before. No offence, but for a beginner it is best to write that kind of code yourself.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477044043, "answer_id": 40173467, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 5909679, "reputation": 222, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "XiCoN JFS", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5909679/xicon-jfs", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/889ea3715fb3f28950ee93ba3df5e652?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1477044043, "question_id": 40110109}
