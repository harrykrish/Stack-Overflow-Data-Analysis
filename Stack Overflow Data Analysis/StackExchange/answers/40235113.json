If a second collection were added the code would refer to the first collection still. I think this could in fact be a feature, just as functional interfaces, which rely on a single method, are employed.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477675606, "answer_id": 40235113, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 1621584, "reputation": 425, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 42, "display_name": "Jeff", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1621584/jeff", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b6a478246788ac00b9d365390af5ec5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1477675606, "question_id": 40234950}
