Also you weren't including the <code>example.com</code> part.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, it looks like that function isn't an <code>IBAction</code> so nothing is calling it. Additionally, you aren't using <code>UISearchBarDelegate</code> which could be useful here.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1476899421, "answer_id": 40050861, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 3830876, "reputation": 4313, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 94, "display_name": "WMios", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3830876/wmios", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/URa0X.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1476899421, "question_id": 39929579}
