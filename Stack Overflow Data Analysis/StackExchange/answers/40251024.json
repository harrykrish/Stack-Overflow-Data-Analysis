{"body": "<p>Answering your question directly, you could have a boolean that toggles on each move:</p>\n\n<pre><code>boolean firstPlayer = true;\nwhile (t.gameIsNotFinished()) {\n    if (firstPlayer)\n        t.validInputPlayerOne();\n    else\n        t.validInputPlayerTwo();\n    firstPlayer = !firstPlayer;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However you have a lot of other issues with your code that you need to address. For example if a player enters an invalid value then it goes to the next player rather than asking for them to reenter the value.</p>\n\n<p>You should also try to have a single <code>validInputPlayer</code> method that works for both players with the <code>firstPlayer</code> variable passed in. At the moment you have a lot of repeated code in those methods.</p>\n", "tags": ["java"], "creation_date": 1477435960, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1477435960, "answer_id": 40251024, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 3705127, "reputation": 10046, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 53, "display_name": "sprinter", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3705127/sprinter", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b03aedaddfa4dc1c2b331f318a724ec7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "title": "Going back and forth with methods in Java", "question_id": 40250907}
