Even when more than one <code>@NgModule()</code> contains a service in providers, you'll get only one instance because they are hoisted in the application root scope.</p>\n\n<p>Lazy loaded modules have their own root scope.</p>\n\n<p>If you provide a service in <code>@Component()</code> every such component instance and it's children will get a different service instance.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477308712, "answer_id": 40216693, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 217408, "reputation": 130599, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 99, "display_name": "G&#252;nter Z&#246;chbauer", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/217408/g%c3%bcnter-z%c3%b6chbauer", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/IlnZm.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1477308712, "question_id": 40216627}
