{"body": "<p>The line</p>\n\n<pre><code>persons = entities.Persons.Take(5);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is a definition of how to retrieve data, but the data itself is not yet retrieved at that point ('delayed execution'). The line is located inside the <code>using(){}</code> construct, so right after that the <code>DbContext</code> is disposed. A while later the View needs the data, the DbContext is consulted, but it is closed already.</p>\n\n<p>Solution:<br>\nRetrieve all data before closing the DbContext. This is frequently done using <code>ToArray()</code> or <code>ToList()</code>, whichever suits you best.</p>\n\n<p>So the line should be e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>persons = entities.Persons.Take(5).ToArray();\n</code></pre>\n", "tags": ["c#", "sql-server", "entity-framework", "asp.net-web-api"], "creation_date": 1461587283, "score": 4, "last_activity_date": 1461587283, "answer_id": 36840583, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 1220550, "reputation": 2823, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "Peter B", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1220550/peter-b", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1osH.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "EF6 The operation cannot be completed because the DbContext has been disposed", "question_id": 36840348}
