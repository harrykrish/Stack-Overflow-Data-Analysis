When looking at the paths in the trace, it seems as if you've installed it with a package from your OS vendor. Instead of doing that you might drop those package and install it using <code>pip</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>pip install awscli</code></p>\n\n<p>This will ensure the currently latest stable version of <code>awscli</code> to be installed. When you want to upgrade again in the future, run <code>pip -U install awscli</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to stick with the OS vendors version you probably want to reinstall awscli completely to fix this issue.</p>\n", "tags": ["python", "aws-cli"], "creation_date": 1477336465, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477336465, "answer_id": 40225822, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 5992118, "reputation": 839, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "dahrens", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5992118/dahrens", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08ae2e7ce567cbfb93d480892bd10fa0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "ImportError: No module named &#39;botocore.parameters&#39;", "question_id": 40225363}
