String literals are quoted with single quotes like in <code>'pending'</code> (always mandatory), while field and table names may be quoted in double quotes like in <code>\"tickets\"</code>, but this is only mandatory, when the field names contain strange characters or are case-sensitive. You were heavily working with string literals, but this is not your intention. you can write</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>qry = \"\"\"SELECT \"id\" FROM \"tickets\" WHERE \"Status\" = 'Pending'\"\"\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or, minimizing quotes, write</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>qry = \"\"\"SELECT id FROM tickets WHERE \"Status\" = 'Pending'\"\"\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>when the field name of the status field is really \"Status\" and not \"STATUS\" (you would have created the table with quotes in that case). </p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477722624, "answer_id": 35395488, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 3991164, "reputation": 1334, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "flaschbier", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3991164/flaschbier", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/ciXQ9.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1477722624, "question_id": 35394421}
