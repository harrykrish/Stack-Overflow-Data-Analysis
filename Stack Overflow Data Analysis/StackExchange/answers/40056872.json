{"body": "<p>This is occurring because of the way <code>UIScrollView</code> is sized in relationship to its parent and children when using autolayout. </p>\n\n<p>The first set of constraints (between the scrollview and its parent) you have ensures that the frame of the scrollview is pinned to the edges of the root view.</p>\n\n<p>The second set of constraints (between the scrollview and its child) is just ensuring that the content size of the scrollview is equal to the size of the subview. In essence, this constraint ends up modifying the content size of the scroll view, not the frame of the subview. The subview is blank and has no content so its size is 0.
