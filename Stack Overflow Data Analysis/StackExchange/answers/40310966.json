{"body": "<p>I contacted the heroku support, and they told me kindly what I was doing something wrong.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that my project folder was 1,2GB, and with the .gitignore it was about 550MB. And in a free account I only can push 500MB maximum.</p>\n\n<p>I looked folder by folder and file by file how many space are they using. And surprisingly it was about 50MB.</p>\n\n<p>The other 500MB to the 550MB were hidden files inside the project which I didn't know anything. Maybe git files, I don't know.</p>\n\n<p>So I copied all the visible files and folders to a new folder, I made a new .gitignore, a new git init, and a new heroku create. Now the main folder was only about 150MB, and when I wanted to push the project to heroku it was only 49MB.</p>\n\n<p>So if you have the same problem I had check the weight of your files, maybe you have big hidden files. And it solved the problem to me.</p>\n", "tags": ["heroku", "ruby-on-rails-5"], "creation_date": 1477678588, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477678588, "answer_id": 40310966, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 6945851, "reputation": 1, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 100, "display_name": "user6945851", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/6945851/user6945851", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f04ad7d281ce70001f1469bd4217beb8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "title": "error on git push heroku master", "question_id": 40221591}
