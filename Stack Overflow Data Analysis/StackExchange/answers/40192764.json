{"body": "<p>The device's unique ID will go through the internet. If there is a node which listens to your communication, it will get all the unique ids of the devices, therefore you need to crypt them, so if the data sent, by any means is listened to by a third party, at least do not hand them the raw data. Also, I would use a salted crypting procedure, so even if the third party would be able to reverse-engineer the algorithm, the result would be far from the real value. And I would choose a discrete name, which does not mean anything for a third party.</p>\n\n<p>In general there is no flag used for logged in state, instead, when a user correctly logs in, some values are stored into <code>$_SESSION</code>, like <code>user_id</code>. In general the client-side is using a cookie for this purpose and you are able to modify cookie values via Javascript. You do not have to go with the general approach if that does not suit you, but unique device ids should never be sent without obfuscation.</p>\n", "tags": ["javascript", "php", "sql", "authentication"], "creation_date": 1477143151, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477143151, "answer_id": 40192764, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 436560, "reputation": 16633, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 86, "display_name": "Lajos Arpad", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/436560/lajos-arpad", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GESV.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "Is this method of authenticating/logging in a user secure?", "question_id": 40192408}
