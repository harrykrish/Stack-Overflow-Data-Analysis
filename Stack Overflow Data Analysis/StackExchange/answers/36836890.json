{"body": "<p>As <a href=\"https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/195\" rel=\"nofollow\">NativeScript does not (yet) \"polyfill\" a crypto module</a> this could be a hard thing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/search?p=1&amp;q=crypto&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93\" rel=\"nofollow\">Searching the code for references to <code>crypto</code></a>, you'll find that there's not that many uses and the uses are not that advanced. What this means is that you should be able to substitute the Node module <em>crypto</em> with <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js\" rel=\"nofollow\">crypto-js</a> which works in a NativeScript environment.</p>\n\n<p>You might need to fork the AWS SDK codebase and substitute the calls to the Node crypto module with calls to the corresponding methods in crypto-js. Unfortunately they do not share the same API.</p>\n\n<p>If you're running Webpack (or anything like it) you should be able to create a \"transformer module\" which will transform Node crypto calls to the corresponding crypto-js calls and then make sure your transformer module is called instead of the Node crypto module via <a href=\"https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-alias\" rel=\"nofollow\">Webpack alias'</a>.</p>\n", "tags": ["javascript", "amazon-web-services", "amazon-sns", "nativescript"], "creation_date": 1461577204, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1461577204, "answer_id": 36836890, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 2533681, "reputation": 2060, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "Emil Oberg", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/2533681/emil-oberg", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/88298b94bea7af1ce8a5c1faef39690c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Installing JavaScript AWS SDK for NativeScript", "question_id": 36834746}
