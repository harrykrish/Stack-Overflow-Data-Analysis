{"body": "<p>Couple more things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>for int21h to perform output, you need to set AH to 9. You're already using AX to store the loop limit; you'd have to use some other register (BX is currently unused), or a memory variable. Also, int21h function 9 changes the value of AL on output - one more reason not to use AX.</li>\n<li>The string needs to be terminated with the $ character.</li>\n<li>and, like obe said, you want the int 21h command before, not after the \"jmp re\" line.</li>\n<li>at the \"fin\" label, you might want to quit the program. The sequence for that is: \"mov ah, 4ch/int 21h\"</li>\n</ul>\n", "tags": ["loops", "assembly", "x86", "nasm", "ms-dos"], "creation_date": 1477791713, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1477791713, "answer_id": 40325315, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 219159, "reputation": 39452, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 73, "display_name": "Seva Alekseyev", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/219159/seva-alekseyev", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/cxM6H.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "display message many time in Assembly language", "question_id": 40322777}
