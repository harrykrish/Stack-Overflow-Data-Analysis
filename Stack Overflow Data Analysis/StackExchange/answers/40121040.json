{"body": "<p>When WooCommerce calculates the tax it first multiples the price without tax by the quantity being ordered. So as far as WooCommerce s concerned, the price to apply tax to is \u00a372.51. It adds 20% to this value. You then get \u00a387.012. It is this final number which is rounded down to \u00a387.01.</p>\n\n<p>To show that mathematically:</p>\n\n<p><code>24.17 x 3 x (1 + 0.2)</code> = <code>87.012</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If you want WC to change the way it calculates that tax you'll have to add the code to your <code>functions.php</code> file. It might look a little like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'woocommerce_get_price_excluding_tax', 'custom_edit_price_function',10,3);\n\nfunction custom_edit_price_function($price, $qty, $product) {\n    //calculate price how you like it here.\n    return $price;\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "tags": ["woocommerce"], "creation_date": 1476843800, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1476843800, "answer_id": 40121040, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 3003045, "reputation": 1670, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 100, "display_name": "James Jones", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3003045/james-jones", "profile_image": "https://graph.facebook.com/100001148539277/picture?type=large"}, "title": "Woocommerce tax rounding issue", "question_id": 36242467}
