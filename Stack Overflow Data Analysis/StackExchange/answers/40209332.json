{"body": "<p>I would expect that some of the things you have tried will help but if that's not the case you will need to identify whether the button was actually triggered or not. To do that you have to capture the next screen or any part of it that uniquely identifies it. Then you will use it a loop with a predefined number of attempts and some wait time between them and click more than once if the click didn't work. So generally something like that (pseudo code):</p>\n\n<pre><code>attempts = 3\nfor attempt in attempts:\n    click(button)\n\n    if (nextScreen is available):\n        break\n\n    sleep(time)\n</code></pre>\n", "tags": ["automation", "sikuli"], "creation_date": 1477270254, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1477270254, "answer_id": 40209332, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 1119381, "reputation": 2810, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 61, "display_name": "Eugene S", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1119381/eugene-s", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aab36e75e2a1b09199da99501429f49e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Sikuli click is not effect", "question_id": 40203062}
