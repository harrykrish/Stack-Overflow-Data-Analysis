{"body": "<p>After several tests and variations it still doesn't work ... </p>\n\n<p>It's really annoying that callbacks functions are not called. \nReally the sendData callback function should be called when the controlTransfer is submitted, no ? but on test it's just never called. Is the control transfer really done ? mystery ...</p>\n\n<p>Also if I get it well there are no really listener in USB. Device can talk only when asked to. This means that once the control transfer is done, i should perform an interrupt transfer on my data endpoint, the 0x81, with a data buffer of 32 bytes but how exactly can i specify the device to send back data with that ? i read about the direction token so is that the first byte of data on interrupt that should have a specific value, indicating the device to effectively write on this buffer and send back data ? </p>\n", "tags": ["linux", "libusb", "libusb-1.0"], "creation_date": 1477525718, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477525718, "answer_id": 40273903, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 7069713, "reputation": 1, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "Belze88", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/7069713/belze88", "profile_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PdL811Yv52M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEw/71LAt1C0U2A/photo.jpg?sz=128"}, "title": "USB error 9 during control transfer", "question_id": 40241304}
