{"body": "<p>The new Release hub in the TFS/VSTS web portal is a complete, ground-up rewrite of the Release experience. It has no relation to or integration with the old Release Management Server product. They are totally separate. The new Release hub is based on the idea of you writing your own deployment scripts in whatever manner works for you and using the Release hub to invoke the deployment scripts and track their progress through your environment pipeline.</p>\n\n<p>You'll want to migrate off of Release Management Server, as it's no longer receiving feature updates, only bugfixes. For migration, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/ALM-Rangers/Migrate-assets-from-RM-server-to-VSTS\" rel=\"nofollow\">ALM Rangers' migration utility</a> (<em>disclosure: I worked on this project</em>).</p>\n\n<p>For kicking off existing Release Management Server releases as part of your build process, I wrote some build tasks for the new TFS build system that you can grab <a href=\"https://github.com/incyclesoftware/build-tasks\" rel=\"nofollow\">on Github</a>. They won't work in Jenkins, but you should be able to use them as a reference point. If you are using TFS build, you can import them using the <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/tfs-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">TFS CLI</a>.</p>\n", "tags": ["tfs", "release-management", "ms-release-management"], "creation_date": 1463760789, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1463760789, "answer_id": 37351263, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 781754, "reputation": 20399, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 82, "display_name": "Daniel Mann", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/781754/daniel-mann", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ee1072483e3ab3c7302820d04935328?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "How does TFS 2015 work with Release Management", "question_id": 37350883}
