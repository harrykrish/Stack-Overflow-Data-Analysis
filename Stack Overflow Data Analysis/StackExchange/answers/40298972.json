You can embed an custom Flash player only.

The swf must be uploaded to your <code>https</code> server.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(2)</strong><br>That <a href=\"https://github.com/Bilibili/flv.js\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Bilibili link</strong></a> is for handling files saved in flv video format (<code>flv</code> means <code>FL</code>ash <code>V</code>ideo fomat). </p>\n\n<p>It just converts (moves) the data to mp4 video format since they both can hold same content &amp; where the mp4 is then decoded by browser (ie: with <em>HTML5</em>, not <em>Flash</em> plugin).
