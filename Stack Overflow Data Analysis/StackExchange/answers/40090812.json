For you, the equilateral triangle will keep on decresing in size till it finally collapses, the point where the dogs meet. So, this will be your view at any point of time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dgXMZ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dgXMZ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>To an observer sitting on one of the dogs, the components of velocities of its adjacent dog at any given point of time are\ndepicted in the third figure. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ie0YL.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ie0YL.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Thus, any given dog feel that\nwhile it is moving towards its adjacent dog at a speed v, the adjacent dog is moving towards it at a speed v/2. Thus the dogs seem to approach each other at a constant rate of <code>v + v/2 = 3v/2</code>. Since the initial distance was <code>s</code>, the time takes to meet is given by, <code>s/(3v/2)</code> = <code>2s/3v</code>.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1476722815, "answer_id": 40090812, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 6354622, "reputation": 1183, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 76, "display_name": "User_Targaryen", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/6354622/user-targaryen", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/rNoam.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1476722815, "question_id": 40089778}
