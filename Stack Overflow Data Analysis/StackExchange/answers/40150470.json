Have a look</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In the question. you mentioned that you get an error when something other than a number is entered. Actually, it is an <code>exception</code> that is thrown when your code tries to convert your input string to a number when it is not possible(<code>guess = int(guess)</code>) due to the input not being a number, just like a <code>space</code>. So, what my code does, is that it catches the exception, and does not allow the program to terminate with the exception.</p>\n\n<p>Just try it once. I know you are beginner but it is better to learn about <code>exception handling</code> as soon as possible, before you write more and more complex codes and applications.</p>\n\n<p>Hope it helps!!</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1476956136, "answer_id": 40150470, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 6354622, "reputation": 1183, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 76, "display_name": "User_Targaryen", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/6354622/user-targaryen", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/rNoam.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1476956136, "question_id": 40150219}
