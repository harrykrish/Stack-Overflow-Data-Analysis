{"body": "<p>Your query </p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT rg.Name AS ResourceName, s.ServerName, rge.VIP, rge.EndPointURL\nFROM ResourceGroup AS rg\nJOIN ServersResourceGroup AS srg ON rg.Id = srg.ResourceGroup_id\nJOIN Servers AS s ON srg.Server_id = s.Id\nLEFT JOIN ResourceGroupEnvironment AS rge ON srg.Environment_id = rge.Environment_id\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can be translated to this Linq statement</p>\n\n<pre><code>var query = from rg in _context.ResourceGroup\n    join srg in _context.ServersResourceGroup on rg.Id equals srg.ResourceGroup_id\n    join s in _context.Servers on srg.Server_id equals s.Id\n    from rge in _context.ResourceGroupEnvironment.Where(x =&gt; srg.Environment_id = x.Environment_id).DefaultIfEmpty()\n    select new{\n        ResourceName = rg.Name, \n        s.ServerName, \n        rge.VIP, \n        rge.EndPointURL\n    };\nvar queryResults = query.ToList();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again you should really compare apples to apples. In your query you are joining 11 tables and you have a <code>where</code> clause which are both omitted from your example query which could be the reason for you different results. As per your comment though this answer just focuses on the 4 tables included in your SQL script.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>About the last (outer) join: See answer on question <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/23558389/1260204,\">LEFT OUTER JOIN in LINQ</a> by <code>@Stefan Steiger</code>. This is an easier to read syntax IMO but either that or the other way using the <code>join</code> syntax would work.</p>\n", "tags": ["c#", "asp.net", "entity-framework", "linq"], "creation_date": 1477662364, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1477662364, "answer_id": 40306448, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 1260204, "reputation": 12470, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 71, "display_name": "Igor", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1260204/igor", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/402e1da680f92d16e7736ab14a696f06?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "SQL query to LINQ to join 5 tables", "question_id": 40295814}
