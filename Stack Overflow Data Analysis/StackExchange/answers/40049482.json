{"body": "<p>I managed to solve it finally.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose we have a graph <code>g</code> which represents the cities and their conections of the <code>TSP</code>. A node represents a city and a weighted edge represents that there is a connection between both cities with the corresponding distance of its weigth.</p>\n\n<p>In order to get the shortest route given its distance, let's delete one to one the edges, and see if they are part of the shortest route. How can we know it? If we delete an edge <code>e</code> from the graph and we call <code>TSP_tf</code> with the known shortest distance <code>min_k</code>, two things can happen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>TSP_tf(min_k) == false</code>. This is, deleting <code>e</code> makes not possible to obtain a route with <code>min_k</code> distance. <code>e</code> is part of the shortest route.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>TSP_tf(min_k) == true</code>. Without the connection <code>e</code>, it's still possible to obtain a route with the same minimum <code>min_k</code> distance. <code>e</code> doesn't take part of the shortest route.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If we apply it progressively to all the edges of the graph, we can obtain the exact shortest route (or better said, one of the shortest routes, because there may be more than one solution).</p>\n\n<pre><code>// min_k is the distance of the shortest path of the TSP represented by the graph g.\nGraph TSP(Graph g, int min_k)\n    Graph shortestPath = g;\n    For (Edge e in g)\n        // Delete the edge e.\n        shortestPath -= e;\n        // e is part of the shortest path.\n        If (TSP_tf(shortestPath, min_k) == false)\n            shortestPath += e;\n        EndIf\n    EndFor\n    Return shortestPath;\nEndTSP\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As we know, the maximum number of nodes of a graph is <code>1/2 * |V| * |V-1|</code>, being <code>|V|</code> the number of nodes. A <code>TSP_tf</code> call is done for each node, so the number of calls to <code>TSP_tf</code> has a peak <code>O(|V|^2)</code>, being an efficient algorithm.</p>\n", "tags": ["algorithm", "traveling-salesman", "np"], "creation_date": 1476468336, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1476468336, "answer_id": 40049482, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 5379399, "reputation": 662, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 100, "display_name": "Santiago Gil", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5379399/santiago-gil", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIKxp.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "Solve Travelling Salesman once you know the distance of the shortest possible route", "question_id": 39732920}
