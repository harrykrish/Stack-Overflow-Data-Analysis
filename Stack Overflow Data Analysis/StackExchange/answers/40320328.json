{"body": "<p>I managed to solve this myself.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Connection Error\" popup that appears is not part of the core Cordova/PhoneGap code, but it is actually part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/leecrossley/cordova-plugin-progress\" rel=\"nofollow\">cordova-plugin-progress plugin</a>. It has a setting that defaults to 10 seconds before displaying that popup:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h3>CRIPageLoadPromptInterval</h3>\n  \n  <p><code>&lt;preference name=\"CRIPageLoadPromptInterval\" value=\"5\" /&gt;</code></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Type</strong>: int</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Default</strong>: 10</p>\n  \n  <p>If the site hasn't loaded after this interval the user will\n  be provided a choice to continue waiting or to retry loading the site.\n  This is turned on by default. If not wanting the prompt the user set\n  the value to 0.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Setting this value in your config.xml file to a higher number (such as 60 if you want a 1 minute timeout) solves the problem. I have confirmed this by setting the value to a 1 second timeout and seeing the popup appear constantly.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps anyone else that may have the same problem in future.</p>\n", "tags": ["android", "ios", "cordova", "phonegap-plugins", "phonegap-build"], "creation_date": 1477752829, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477752829, "answer_id": 40320328, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 3509051, "reputation": 128, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 75, "display_name": "Phil", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3509051/phil", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/88875be4ac14f598ac33ab61dc1a2014?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "title": "Increasing timeout to get rid of &quot;The server is taking longer than expected to respond&quot; in a Cordova/PhoneGap app", "question_id": 40250854}
