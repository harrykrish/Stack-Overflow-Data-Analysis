{"body": "<p>Before server side scripting (PHP, Ruby, node.js) there was server side programming.</p>\n\n<p>One of the original interfaces between web servers and back-end processes was the Common Gateway Interface (CGI). It was introduced in the early 90s by the NCSA back-end team at the same time forms was introduced into HTML by Tim Berners-Lee (who was also at NCSA at the time). So forms was introduced at roughly the same time CGI was invented.</p>\n\n<p>Initially a lot of people wrote CGI programs in C. I was one of those who had to do so as a homework assignment. Instead of a giant all-encompassing framework we wrote small C programs that read from stdin and print to stdout (we printed HTTP response, not just the HTML as per CGI spec). A website had lots of these small programs each doing one small thing and updated some database (sometimes that database was just a flat file).</p>\n\n<p>Almost as soon as it was introduced people also started writing CGI scripts in Perl. So there was really no transition period between C programs and scripting languages. People simply stopped writing CGI scripts in C because it was faster to do so in scripting languages.</p>\n", "tags": ["html", "forms"], "creation_date": 1477539625, "score": 109, "last_activity_date": 1477539625, "answer_id": 40275734, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 167735, "reputation": 45967, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "slebetman", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/167735/slebetman", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5deb8de031f80c23f19e9b6d389e5afe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "How were HTML forms interpreted in the early 90s?", "question_id": 40275484}
