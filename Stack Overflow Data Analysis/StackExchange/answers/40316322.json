{"body": "<p>Thanks for your replies! I just found that, for some reason in iOS 10 the viewDidLayoutSubviews did get called as it was in iOS 9. Actually I was setting the player layer's frame in the viewdidlayoutsubviews method. Since it didn't get called, I was not able to see the player on screen. What I did was, set the player layer's frame in the loadPlayer method above.And it works fine. Thanks! Hope this helps someone.</p>\n", "tags": ["ios", "objective-c", "video", "avfoundation", "avplayeritem"], "creation_date": 1477718978, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477718978, "answer_id": 40316322, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 5912335, "reputation": 6, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "Badhan Ganesh", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5912335/badhan-ganesh", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/OIOJu.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "iOS 10 - AVPlayer shows black screen when playing video", "question_id": 40283596}
