Foundation still uses the <code>load</code> function, which was deprecated 4 years ago in jQuery 1.8 and finally <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2286\" rel=\"nofollow\">removed in jQuery 3.0</a>. Since there is another jQuery Function called <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/load/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>load</code></a>, which is called instead, you get this rather cryptic error message.</p>\n\n<p>Even the current relased Version of Zurb Foundation 6.2.3 and jQuery 3 are incompatible. The <a href=\"https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/pull/8923\" rel=\"nofollow\">fix for your problem</a> is already merged and should be released with <a href=\"https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/milestone/29\" rel=\"nofollow\">version 6.2.4</a> which was to be released about 2 months ago, but still isn't. (Its 78% complete according to the GitHub page)</p>\n\n<p>So I guess the only solution is to a) ignore the error or b) patch the code yourself as described <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/37915907/935676\">in this answer</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Foundation 6.2.4 was released October 21, 2016 and now supports jQuery 3.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477761898, "answer_id": 39625885, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 935676, "reputation": 1847, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "amoebe", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/935676/amoebe", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/ITQRV.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1477761898, "question_id": 38400081}
