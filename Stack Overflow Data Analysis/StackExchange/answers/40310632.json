{"body": "<p>The difference between <code>function(a)</code> and <code>a.function()</code> is the difference between a function and a method. A function is called <code>function(a)</code> and is not called on a variable. <code>a.function()</code> is actually a method and is called on an instance variable. When <code>a.function()</code> is called, whatever class <code>a</code> is, has a method <code>function()</code> that can be called on that variable. Whereas, when <code>function(a)</code> is called, a function is called with <code>a</code> as the parameter. An example of this is</p>\n\n<pre><code>' '.join(['a','b','c'])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The method <code>join</code> is called on the string <code>' '</code> (as <code>join</code> is a method that belongs to the <code>str</code> class) and takes the parameter <code>['a', 'b', 'c']</code>. </p>\n", "tags": ["python", "function"], "creation_date": 1477677087, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1477677087, "answer_id": 40310632, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 5021321, "reputation": 2041, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 75, "display_name": "Eli Sadoff", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5021321/eli-sadoff", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29f10a1b457e63d44e3a221e89e32c17?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Python- Calling Functions", "question_id": 40310581}
