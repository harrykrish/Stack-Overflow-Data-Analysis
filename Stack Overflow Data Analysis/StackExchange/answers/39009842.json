Add your voter-id to the response: 43z'</p>\n\n<p>Then the user would need to text back: B 43z.</p>\n\n<p>You end-point would identify the answer 'B', and '43z' would identify the respondent as 'John' (supposing you have a database look-up mapping John to 43z on your sever).</p>\n\n<p>Then you can get a total count for who the winner should be, and also know each user's response for the conversation.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1472397656, "answer_id": 39009842, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 1709076, "reputation": 509, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 68, "display_name": "user1709076", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1709076/user1709076", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a40bbd2ec2e3617c11185b007a54d473?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1472397656, "question_id": 39009688}
