Make sure to do this </p>\n\n<p><em>Exactly</em> how to integrate Autofac with your app really depends on what kind of app you have (Windows Service? MVC? Web API? Windows Forms? UAP?) and what your expectations around lifetime scope usage are. None of that was included in your question. However, if you search the web for \"<code>autofac constructservicesusing</code>\" you come up with plenty of examples including several other StackOverflow questions on the same topic.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://kevsoft.net/2015/09/14/getting-along-with-automapper-and-autofac.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's a simple example that shows pretty much exactly what you're doing.</a> If you're using an MVC or Web API app and need per-request-scope support, <a href=\"http://www.paraesthesia.com/archive/2014/03/25/automapper-autofac-web-api-and-per-request-dependency-lifetime-scopes.aspx/\" rel=\"nofollow\">I have a full blog walkthrough on that</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By way of a note, I'm not sure if the <code>AutoActivate</code> call is really necessary. <code>SingleInstance</code> is thread-safe and it doesn't actually take that long to build an AutoMapper profile lazily. You may want to try without it, especially if AutoMapper itself isn't executing that part until after <code>AutoActivate</code> has run.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477664128, "answer_id": 40306029, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 8116, "reputation": 11227, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 62, "display_name": "Travis Illig", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/8116/travis-illig", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b473ad19f5781cd5f17a65a670f3b37?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1477664128, "question_id": 40293597}
