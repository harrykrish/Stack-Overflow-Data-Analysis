It will automatically adds the teams to the UI and then all needs to do is mark them to allow clone/push/pull permissions. BUT !! the 'update' hook will control the push permissions for each branch. So thats answers 3 &amp; 4.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>3,4. Yes we must still use the 'update' hook to set specific people to push to specific branches. And Yes, marking the team allowing the whole team members to clone.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE !!</p>\n\n<p>As for question 2 - As @sheepy answered above in the remarks of the question.
