{"title": "Automated Padding for Responsive Design", "tags": ["html", "css", "text", "responsive-design", "responsive"], "creation_date": 1476659724, "score": 1, "body": "<p>Your pixel-based heights on divs aren't necessary; once you get rid of those, the vertical padding won't be necessary either. CSS will just stack your stuff on its own.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: So: remove your height declarations from #contentTwo, #contentTwo #insert1 #insert1_textblock, #container #main #contentTwo #insert2 #insert2_textblock. That way your divs will stack with automatic heights and not with pixel-based declarations, which means they won't overlap each other.</p>\n\n<p>Then you'll be able to float #insert-1 left and float #insert-2 right. After that, you'll want to clear your floats for the two columns. (For more information on floats and clearing them, see <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/</a> ). In this instance, the easiest way to do it is to add overflow:hidden to the parent container, which in this case is #content-2. </p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1476806063, "answer_id": 40076531, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 7024289, "reputation": 30, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "The Great Hambino", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/7024289/the-great-hambino", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/qr1Vi.png?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1476806063, "question_id": 40076421}
