{"body": "<p>Regarding your last question about relative (within-section) alignment and absolute (in memory at runtime) -  you don't have to worry too much. Just below the section of the manual you quoted which warns about <code>ALIGN</code> not checking the section alignment, you have this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Both ALIGN and ALIGNB do call SECTALIGN macro implicitly. See section <a href=\"http://www.nasm.us/doc/nasmdoc4.html#section-4.11.13\" rel=\"nofollow\">4.11.13</a> for details. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So basically <code>ALIGN</code> doesn't <em>check</em> that the alignment is sensible, but it does call the <code>SECTALIGN</code> macro so that the alignment <em>will be</em> sensible. In particular, all the implicit <code>SECTALIGN</code> calls should insure that the section is aligned to the largest alignment specified by any align call.</p>\n\n<p>The warning about <code>ALIGN</code> not checking then probably only applies to more obscure cases, e.g., when assembling into formats that don't support section alignment, when specifying an alignment larger than that supported by a section, or when <code>SECTALIGN OFF</code> has been called to disable <code>SECTALIGN</code>.</p>\n", "tags": ["assembly", "x86", "nasm", "yasm"], "creation_date": 1475782644, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1475782644, "answer_id": 39904324, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 149138, "reputation": 6036, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 67, "display_name": "BeeOnRope", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/149138/beeonrope", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cfd457233c8ebbab383475fc097442d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "The effect of code alignment in timing main loops in assembly", "question_id": 33438592}
