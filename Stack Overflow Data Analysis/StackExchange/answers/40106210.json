{"body": "<p>I finally solved it. The problem had nothing to do with described routes, rather the global rest configuration:</p>\n\n<pre><code>RestConfiguration restConfiguration = new RestConfiguration();\nrestConfiguration.setComponent(\"servlet\");\nrestConfiguration.setBindingMode(RestConfiguration.RestBindingMode.json);\nrestConfiguration.setHost(\"localhost\");\nrestConfiguration.setPort(serverPort);\n\ncamelContext.setRestConfiguration(restConfiguration);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The third line, setting the binding mode, is unnecessary as I state explicitly when I'd like to map to JSON and also which framework I use. After I remove this line everything works like a charm.</p>\n\n<p>At this moment I don't exactly know how or why this has solved my problem, but I'm happy it did ;)</p>\n", "tags": ["java", "json", "jackson", "marshalling", "camel"], "creation_date": 1476787790, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1476787790, "answer_id": 40106210, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 1306546, "reputation": 2412, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 84, "display_name": "verhage", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1306546/verhage", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3f0b2136fa1ef8c24b35b9ab3c1de375?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Apache camel cannot marshal to JSON from InputStreamCache", "question_id": 40044764}
