Some CMS even use unique page id as parameter in the URL to reference the page they are showing. But it's not necessary. All you need is just the page object that reference to an action path. </p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477641867, "answer_id": 15027353, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 573032, "reputation": 34515, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 91, "display_name": "Roman C", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/573032/roman-c", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bca617231294691f95f0e9f0ee623630?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1477641867, "question_id": 14955243}
