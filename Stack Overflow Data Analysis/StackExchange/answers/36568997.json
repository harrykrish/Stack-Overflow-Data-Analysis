{"body": "<p>Yes, I got it. I selected GoogleMap Activity instead of selecting blank activity and it just created an google map fragment XML file. For getting indoor building i just wrote some java code to move the camera position to the building by specifying latitude &amp; longitude of it. On zooming to the building which is having floors information on google, floorpicker is automatically showed and then we can toggle it. This google map fragment is having direction compass,zoom controls,GPS enable button on it. We can enable or disable them pro-grammatically.</p>\n", "tags": ["android", "android-studio", "google-indoor-maps"], "creation_date": 1460453081, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1460453081, "answer_id": 36568997, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 6043385, "reputation": 6, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 75, "display_name": "Abhinay", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/6043385/abhinay", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f22572285b36bef0d9227a54a8ae9c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "title": "How to implement google indoor floor map of one building in my android activity with all floor picker options", "question_id": 35988796}
