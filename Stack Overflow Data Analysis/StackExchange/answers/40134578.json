Or are any errors showing up in the domino log?</p>\n\n<p>Also, do the table headers get drawn and just not the content, or are you not even getting a table header?</p>\n\n<p>The only other thing that jumps out slightly, is Oliver used bower for the installation, where as you have copy/pasted the resources you need. As such, the file structure is slightly different, so may be worth checking if there are any references to files/scripts with the bower file path?</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and are you using resource aggregation? I think some of the CSS uses relative paths so you might just need to update these?</p>\n\n<p>Are you initialising the table?</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1476888460, "answer_id": 40134578, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 4690780, "reputation": 356, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 88, "display_name": "Chris Richards", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/4690780/chris-richards", "profile_image": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XECn5yTUhxA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB_U/yRfIBs3Mrp8/photo.jpg?sz=128"}, "last_edit_date": 1476888460, "question_id": 40113817}
