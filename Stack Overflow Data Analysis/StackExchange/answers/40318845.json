{"body": "<p>Your terminology is a little confused, although it's largely Stanford's fault for its slightly confusing use of terms. A \"parse tree\" is any tree-based representation of a sentence, including both examples you've given above (i.e. a \"dependency tree\" is a kind of parse tree). The kind of tree that you want to get is called a \"constituency tree\"; the difference between them is described at <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/10401076/1709587\">Difference between constituency parser and dependency parser</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Constituency tree</h3>\n\n<pre><code>(ROOT\n  (S\n    (NP (NNP John))\n    (VP (VBZ likes)\n      (NP (PRP him)))\n    (. .)))\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Dependency tree</h3>\n\n<pre><code>nsubj(likes-2, John-1)\nroot(ROOT-0, likes-2)\ndobj(likes-2, him-3)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, spaCy doesn't yet support constituency parsing.
