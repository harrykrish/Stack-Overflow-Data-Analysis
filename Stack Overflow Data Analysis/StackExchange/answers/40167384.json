{"body": "<p>Probably because you should break out of that loop when you find a winner (all three equal to eachother, but not equal to ' '). Even if you find a winner first, if an empty set of three occurs after that, it satisfies the condition but stores a blank in returnvalue, overwriting the previously found winning x or o. Or you could add <code>... != ' '</code> to your condition there, because you really don't care if all three are empty at that point. Stepping through a debugger or adding temporary diagnostics print outs could really help you here.</p>\n\n<p>Just a guess at a glance.</p>\n", "tags": ["arrays", "function", "member"], "creation_date": 1477016633, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477016633, "answer_id": 40167384, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 616460, "reputation": 23170, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 96, "display_name": "Jason C", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/616460/jason-c", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yiloe.png?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "3D arrays and member functions to check winner to 3D tic-tac-toe", "community_owned_date": 1477016633, "question_id": 40167338}
