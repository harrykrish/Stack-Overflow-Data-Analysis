The accepted answer is correct, no doubts, after my account expired, wallet file generator continued to work because certificates were valid and everything was just fine.</p>\n\n<p>But what happened to me is either bad luck or I don't know. So, when my account expired as I said, everything was fine, except opening wallet files on iPhone. So I was always getting an error \"Safari can't download this file\". I tried everything but only one thing solved my problem:</p>\n\n<p><strong>New developer account subscription</strong></p>\n\n<p>After I order my new subscription I just generated new Pass Type certificate, updated my web service and server to work with new certs and with new team id and at that point I was able again to load my generated wallet files into iPhone Wallet App.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477689766, "answer_id": 40313326, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 2641777, "reputation": 481, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "hellwd", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/2641777/hellwd", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/kILBv.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1477689766, "question_id": 40107530}
