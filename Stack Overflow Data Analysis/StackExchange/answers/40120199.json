{"body": "<p>A few suggestion for you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You should use JUnit rather than building your own testing mechanism. Rather than returning boolean values and printing error messages you could have very clear test statements like <code>assertEquals(\"default num1 is zero\", 0, new TwoNumbers().getFirstNum())</code></li>\n<li>Keep your getters and setters clean: getters should just return the value and setters should just set the value.</li>\n<li>If there's an error condition such as the argument being outside an expected range then throw and exception rather than returning a boolean.</li>\n<li>Have unit tests confirming that the correct exceptions are thrown under the right conditions (using JUnit's <code>expected</code> annotation key).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you start with those changes I suspect your issues will become pretty obvious pretty quickly and you'll be learning better practices from the start.</p>\n", "tags": ["java"], "creation_date": 1476837260, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1476837260, "answer_id": 40120199, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 3705127, "reputation": 10046, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 53, "display_name": "sprinter", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3705127/sprinter", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b03aedaddfa4dc1c2b331f318a724ec7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "title": "Using Testing Class to see if two integer values fit arguments", "question_id": 40120098}
