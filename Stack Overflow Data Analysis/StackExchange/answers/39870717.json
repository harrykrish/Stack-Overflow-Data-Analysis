What I was looking was for the server to give the user access to control the analysis. But using independent plugins to do static analysis could work.</p>\n\n<p>I solved this issue by splitting the plugin into </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A plugin for doing inline analysis work (if a need for doing our own static analysis arises)</li>\n<li>A WebApp to classify issues, listing them by projects, etc. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This approach seemed more attractive when after discussion, we decided that all functions we wanted out widget to do, our WebApp itself could do. From SonarQube version 6.2, the ruby APIs are going to be deprecated and so moving to a REST-based approach would give an enduring solution.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477473377, "answer_id": 39870717, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 4465100, "reputation": 55, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 100, "display_name": "Dhruvan Ganesh", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/4465100/dhruvan-ganesh", "profile_image": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DjaqM9KNFCg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAvc/rqde4yAXg9Y/photo.jpg?sz=128"}, "last_edit_date": 1477473377, "question_id": 39573214}
