{"body": "<p><em>They inserted autolayout a few versions ago, exactly for this foreseeable reason. It's highly discouraged to use storyboards without autolayout, if you want to work with size classes, different devices with different screen resolutions, orientations, ecc.</em> </p>\n\n<p><strong>My suggestion</strong> is revert the project to previous commit, reopen it with <strong>xcode7</strong>, add the needed constraint and reopen with xcode8 (you will still have problems, because of the many bugs of the new storyboard but they are mostly fixable).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Another option</strong> to keep working with in <strong>xcode8</strong> it is to use a \"freeform\" simulated size from the Size inspector of the view controller and adapt the sizes to the old viewcontroller dimensions, but you will have to manage compatibility with all devices sizes programmatically, as i hope it is already being done. It doesn't anyway guarantee that everything works</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Cw2A.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Cw2A.png\" alt=\"Free Form\"></a></p>\n", "tags": ["ios", "objective-c", "xcode"], "creation_date": 1476800353, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1476800353, "answer_id": 40110743, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 691977, "reputation": 838, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 91, "display_name": "jalone", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/691977/jalone", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d7547928cf48f2d88c4e2c993dd3bc14?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Xcode 8 storyboard error", "question_id": 40110432}
