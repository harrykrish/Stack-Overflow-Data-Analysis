{"body": "<p>I have actually done something like this. You need to use a <code>canvas</code> in your HTML and to have a finite number of possible images or possibly some Javascript <code>function</code>s to draw the thing the user wants. Those images/<code>function</code>s should be put together in your <code>canvas</code> to enable the user to preview what is his picture and a control set to change things.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/923885/capture-html-canvas-as-gif-jpg-png-pdf\">SO post</a> shows you how you can get a png from a <code>canvas</code>. I suggest that you should have a save button, where the user finalizes the picture and this should send the picture to the server, where it will be stored. The download feature should download that picture.</p>\n\n<p>I have done this differently. I have used <code>canvas</code> as a preview and when the user finalized the settings, those were sent to the server as JSON where the final picture was put together. </p>\n", "tags": ["javascript", "image", "photoshop"], "creation_date": 1477035981, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1477035981, "answer_id": 40171064, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 436560, "reputation": 16633, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 86, "display_name": "Lajos Arpad", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/436560/lajos-arpad", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GESV.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "Modify &amp; Export a PNG", "question_id": 40168418}
