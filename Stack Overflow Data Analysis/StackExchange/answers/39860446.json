So firstly you have to consider using services to play media on device.</p>\n\n<p>However If you still want to play media from Activity then, the main cause you are not able to get it is, you are not implementing MediaPlayer lifecycle in well manner. Follow my answer on another question where cause of problem was the same. Here is the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39308890/imagebutton-with-sound-is-not-working/39309699#39309699\">link</a>. You have to implement lifecycle of MediaPlayer class perfectly otherwise it would produce exception or even crashes.</p>\n\n<p>I hope it will help.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1475999559, "answer_id": 39860446, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 4755399, "reputation": 224, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 90, "display_name": "Dushyant Suthar", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/4755399/dushyant-suthar", "profile_image": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-msTJIz_air4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHk/rYWTAGBnSRk/photo.jpg?sz=128"}, "last_edit_date": 1475999559, "question_id": 39858463}
