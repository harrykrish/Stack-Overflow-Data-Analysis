{"body": "<p>RVargas asked a good question which is where are other assets being loaded form in the page.  Interestly, my javascripts, which live in the grails-app/assets/stylesheet directory are being loaded as follows:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/assets/jquery-2.2.0.min.js?compile=false\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice no reference to the 'stylesheet' subdirectory.  So apparently grails is somehow resolving all assets as if they all lived in the assets directory not the individual subfolder javascripts/images/stylesheets.    Apparently jquery-ui doesn't know this so it looks for image assets in assets/images/ subdirectory.  </p>\n\n<p>In order to get jquery-ui working properly I had to create an images directory under assets/javascripts e.g. assets/javascripts/images and put the jquery image assets in there for the app to be able to find them using the assets/images url.</p>\n", "tags": ["jquery", "jquery-ui", "grails"], "creation_date": 1477691060, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477691060, "answer_id": 40313593, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 1023110, "reputation": 640, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 61, "display_name": "user1023110", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1023110/user1023110", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0364c60023a65450d5e83f1fa0d09909?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "jquery-ui isn&#39;t loading ui images properly in grails", "question_id": 40255528}
