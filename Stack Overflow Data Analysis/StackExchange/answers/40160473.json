{"body": "<p>In general, validating parameters in constructor is <em>not a bad</em> practice, it's always depends on what you are actually implementing.</p>\n\n<p>In your particular case I recommend you the following:</p>\n\n<p>1) If you want to validate data in constructor, don't throw <code>NullPointerException</code>, but rather <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>;</p>\n\n<p>2) As your class is named <code>EmailSubjectValidator</code>, I would not validate the data in constructor. You can use constructor for initialising the data instead. It would be much better to have <code>validate()</code> method which will do this;</p>\n\n<p>3) Validating the data is a common thing to do in a lot of cases, so it may be a good idea to create a <code>Validator</code> interface with single <code>validate()</code> method for making validation;</p>\n", "tags": ["java"], "creation_date": 1476983313, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1476983313, "answer_id": 40160473, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 1889928, "reputation": 1956, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 90, "display_name": "Yuriy Yunikov", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1889928/yuriy-yunikov", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c6b04157e65ab1a1e0e61d220d06341d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "Validating data in constructor and throwing exceptions", "question_id": 40160266}
