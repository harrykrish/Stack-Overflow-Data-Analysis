In the Ohai documentation this line describes the <code>:Name</code> field:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Required.

This value must be a valid Ruby class name, starting with a capital letter and containing only alphanumeric characters</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I read <code>valid Ruby class name</code> not as a comment on the validity of the syntax, but as intending the Ruby class was an existing one (this is my first time attempting Ruby code!).
