{"body": "<p>Going to answer this, maybe it will be useful for other. My token was wrong. The encoding has changed with recent updates. I did actually search all over stack overflow for this and it was to my understanding that I had to convert the <code>Data</code> to a <code>String</code> using the <code>base64string</code>. However I noticed this string had a few odd characters in it such as <code>\\</code>. I eventually ended up making a <code>Data</code> extension:</p>\n\n<pre><code>extension Data {\n\n    func hexString() -&gt; String {\n        return self.reduce(\"\") { string, byte in\n            string + String(format: \"%02X\", byte)\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This converts the <code>Data</code> to the correct format. So if this is how you do your conversion, plus all the entitlements are set, you remember to add the new methods:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@available(iOS 10.0, *)\nfunc userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, willPresent notification: UNNotification, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -&gt; Void) {\n    print(\"Got a push!\")\n}\n\n\n@available(iOS 10.0, *)\nfunc userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -&gt; Void) {\n    print(\"Got a push!\")\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and set the delegate object in <code>didFinishLaunchingWithOptions</code> everything should be good to go.</p>\n", "tags": ["ios", "swift", "apple-push-notifications", "swift3"], "creation_date": 1475766147, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1475766147, "answer_id": 39899448, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 4083744, "reputation": 1624, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 68, "display_name": "Kex", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/4083744/kex", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/eWDfZ.png?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "Trouble receiving push notifications in iOS10 and iOS9", "question_id": 39789521}
