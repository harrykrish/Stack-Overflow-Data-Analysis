{"body": "<p>I went to the other posts as @maulik and @FreeMan suggested. The solutions there didn't work, but it got me to look at something closer. Clicking the lightbulb next to the offending line (is that ReShaper or Visual Studio that does that?), it suggested I change my formatting from:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;EventTrigger RoutedEvent=\"MouseEnter\" SourceName=\"imgCenter\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;EventTrigger SourceName=\"imgCenter\"&gt;\n    &lt;EventTrigger.RoutedEvent&gt;MouseEnter&lt;/EventTrigger.RoutedEvent&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even though they are only syntactically different, the second version doesn't show an error. I'm not sure I really like this solution--I may have to just uninstall and reinstall ReSharper to keep the same syntax--but it did get rid of the error.</p>\n", "tags": ["wpf", "xaml", "visual-studio-2015"], "creation_date": 1474397506, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1474397506, "answer_id": 39601712, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 611716, "reputation": 651, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 69, "display_name": "Frecklefoot", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/611716/frecklefoot", "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/f4i2e.jpg?s=128&g=1"}, "title": "Visual Studio gives error on valid XAML", "question_id": 39597577}
