This is solved by using a different pipe and first creating said pipe with the <code>mkfifo</code> command prior to attempting to open a pipe.</p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477675769, "answer_id": 40155533, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 3830784, "reputation": 81, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 90, "display_name": "user3830784", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3830784/user3830784", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e99c42399c833b0ace266cd1b49806e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "last_edit_date": 1477675769, "question_id": 40133021}
