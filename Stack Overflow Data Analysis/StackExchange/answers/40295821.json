To simulate the coordinate system you want, you need to flip all the <code>y</code>-values over the line <code>y=0</code> (aka the <code>x</code>-axis).</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few <code>y</code>-values and their corresponding corrections you can use as tests. Note that I'm assuming <code>y</code> has already been scaled properly; it looks like you've already got that part.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>150 -> 0</li>\n<li>0 -> 150</li>\n<li>-150 -> 300</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The pattern is <code>y_new = -(y_old - 150)</code> where 150 is <code>canvas_height/2</code>. Therefore, after scaling you need to apply this formula to all your <code>y</code> values.</p>\n\n<p>To shift the <code>y</code>-axis to the center you need to do the same sort of thing to derive the appropriate linear transformation. </p>\n", "last_activity_date": 1477675361, "answer_id": 40295821, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 204305, "reputation": 1043, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 100, "display_name": "Jake Mitchell", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/204305/jake-mitchell", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fa6165d3bcb50e58e60304807f4090a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "last_edit_date": 1477675361, "question_id": 40295620}
