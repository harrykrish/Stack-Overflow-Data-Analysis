{"body": "<p>I ran into a similar problem and think it had the same cause. It seems like Google only scans a fixed-size chunk at the beginning of canonical pages looking for <code>&lt;link rel=\"amphtml\"&gt;</code> tags pointing at AMP documents.</p>\n\n<p>My AMP pages stopped being returned by Google searches or the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/reference/acceleratedmobilepageurl/rest/v1/ampUrls/batchGet\" rel=\"nofollow\">ampUrls.batchGet API</a> once I added JSON-LD structured data above <code>&lt;link rel=\"amphtml\"&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> in my canonical pages; doing so resulted in the <code>&lt;link rel=\"amphtml\"&gt;</code> tags often not appearing until ~1300 bytes into the file.</p>\n\n<p>After I moved <code>&lt;link rel=\"amphtml\"&gt;</code> back near the top of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section, just below <code>&lt;meta charset&gt;</code>, and requested that my canonical pages be recrawled, the ampUrls.batchGet API was reporting the AMP versions within eight hours.</p>\n\n<p>Google appears to be returning the AMP version of the canonical page that you mentioned now, but I also note that the page now includes <code>&lt;link rel=\"amphtml\" href=\"http://amp.jmbullion.com/5-gram-perth-mint-gold-bar/\"&gt;</code> very close to its beginning. In the version of your page returned by the Google Cache, apparently crawled on 2016-10-27, <code>&lt;link rel=\"amphtml\"&gt;</code> appears much later, 4975 bytes into the file. This is why I think you were experiencing the same problem as me.</p>\n\n<p>I've filed an <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/5909\" rel=\"nofollow\">amphtml bug requesting that this be clarified in the documentation</a>.</p>\n", "tags": ["amp-html"], "creation_date": 1477751837, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1477751837, "answer_id": 40320172, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 6882947, "reputation": 16, "user_type": "registered", "display_name": "derat", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/6882947/derat", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/812309e23894f59fed0da84891a5cd00?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"}, "title": "AMPs have stopped appearing in Search Results Pages.
