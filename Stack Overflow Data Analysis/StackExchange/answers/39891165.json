{"title": "Can we use @ symbol in variable name php", "tags": ["php"], "creation_date": 1475742447, "score": 4, "body": "<p>The @ is the error suppression operator in PHP, have a look at the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">documentation</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In your example</strong>, it is used before the variable name to avoid the E_NOTICE error there. If in the $_POST array, the 'Days' key is not set it will throw an E_NOTICE message, but @ is used there to avoid that E_NOTICE.</p>\n\n<p>The cause of the code not working on the server is probably due to the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/intro.scream.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">scream.enabled directive in your php.ini</a> configuration being disabled.</p>\n\n<p>Disabling <code>scream</code> should fix the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Change the directive in your php.ini, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>scream.enabled = 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you want to disable it during run-time, then you can use ini_set as stated in the manual:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ini_set('scream.enabled', false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Someone in the comments pointed out I haven't been thorough enough with my answer. I will try to amend my mistake in this here edit :).</em></p>\n\n<p>The reason scream (and disabling the @) can / will break the code is due to the fact that the variable doesn't have a value. If the remainder of the code tries to use the variable it will throw an error. </p>\n\n<p>Also, an E_NOTICE can throw an error if you attach an error handler to it.\nA quote from <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10520390/stop-script-execution-upon-notice-warning\">another question</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The above code will throw an ErrorException any time an E_NOTICE or\n  E_WARNING is raised, effectively terminating script output (if the\n  exception isn't caught). Throwing exceptions on PHP errors is best\n  combined with a parallel exception handling strategy\n  (set_exception_handler) to gracefully terminate in production\n  environments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "last_activity_date": 1475743770, "answer_id": 39891165, "is_accepted": true, "owner": {"user_id": 5033031, "reputation": 464, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 80, "display_name": "Rick van Lieshout", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5033031/rick-van-lieshout", "profile_image": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-K3kbNrRBQ2g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAATE/XxcsC4rT39o/photo.jpg?sz=128"}, "last_edit_date": 1475743770, "question_id": 39888215}
