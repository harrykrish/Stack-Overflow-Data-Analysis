{"body": "<p>I think you need to split the app into 2 layers  (assuming this is possible):</p>\n\n<p>1) the REST service layer </p>\n\n<p>2) the Angular2 Front End layer</p>\n\n<p>Node.js (maybe with the help of express) would run the REST service piece.</p>\n\n<p>Angular2 would be the Front End part, calling the REST services offered by the Node server.</p>\n\n<p>In such a scenario you would not have to 'install' Angular2 on Node. You rather would have to prepare a development environment (I suggest to use also Angular2 CLI) for Angular and start the development against the available services. Unfortunately these means that it may be difficult for you to reuse whatever pure FE logic has been developed so far (maybe with the exception of the css part).</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps</p>\n", "tags": ["javascript", "node.js", "angular2"], "creation_date": 1477408688, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1477408688, "answer_id": 40243729, "is_accepted": false, "owner": {"user_id": 5699993, "reputation": 1019, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 19, "display_name": "Picci", "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/5699993/picci", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5428464065272667ef39b9415d8e8722?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1"}, "title": "Add angular2 into existing nodejs app", "question_id": 40243383}
